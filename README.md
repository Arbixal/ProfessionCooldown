# Profession Cooldown
Profession Cooldown (PCD) tracks the cooldown of profession abilities across the characters on your account. It's fairly simple, and mostly consists of a simple overview.
In order to track a given profession cooldown, the ability first has to be on cooldown. That means, if one is to create a piece of Mooncloth, the addon will track it.
Your profession window has to be open, in order to record active cooldowns. Currently it tracks:

- Leatherworking: Salt shaker.
- Alchemy: All transmutes
- Jewelcrafting: Brilliant Glass
- Tailoring: Mooncloth and TBC cloths

## Commands:

- /pcd - toggles the visibility of the window.
- /reset - resets the position of the window.
- /resetalldata - resets all data for the addon.
- /reset charactername - resets the data for the given charactername. Useful if changing professions or deleting a character.
